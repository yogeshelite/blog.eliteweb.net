                <h3>Decentralized Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>This is one of the primary characteristics of blockchain. There is no need to have intermediaries or trusted third parties validate transactions, because each transaction is recorded on a distributed ledger that itself serves as a tamper-proof “consensus mechanism”.</p>

                <h3>Transparency And Trust</h3>
                <p>Because each transaction is recorded and validated on a decentralized and publicly visible ledger (the blockchain), users enjoy transparency and trust that the system is working as intended</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Immutability And Security</h3>
                <p>Making unauthorized changes to a blockchain is next to impossible. Because the blockchain is distributed over a robust network of computers or nodes, compromising one or even multiple nodes has no effect on the blockchain, which operates by consensus. This makes blockchain extremely attractive as an immutable ledger that is highly resistant to hacker attacks.</p>

                <h3>Cheaper Transaction Costs</h3>
                <p>A blockchain transaction system does not require any third party intermediaries to carry out, approve, or verify transactions. Since there is no middleman, and instructions are executed by the blockchain system itself, you can greatly reduce the time and money spent processing a transaction.</p>
